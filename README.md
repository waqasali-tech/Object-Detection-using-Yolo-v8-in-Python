Object-Detection-using-Yolo-v8-in-Python
Real-time cat and dog detection using YOLOv8 and a live camera feed. Built with Python & OpenCV for fast and accurate object recognition.

🐾 Cat & Dog Detection with YOLOv8
This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify cats and dogs in real-time using a live camera feed.
It’s built with Python and OpenCV, making it fast, accurate, and easy to run on most systems.

📌 Features
🎯 Real-time Detection of cats and dogs using your webcam.
⚡ Fast & Accurate YOLOv8 model from Ultralytics.
🖼 Bounding Boxes & Labels for detected animals.
📷 Works with any connected camera.
🐍 Easy to customize for other objects.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
OpenCV
Ultralytics YOLOv8
Webcam or camera device


🧠 How It Works
The YOLOv8 model processes frames from your webcam in real-time.
It detects and classifies objects into "Cat" or "Dog".
Bounding boxes and labels are drawn around detected animals.
📸 Example Output
[ Cat Detected at (x1, y1, x2, y2) ]
[ Dog Detected at (x1, y1, x2, y2) ]
